    "# World Happiness Dataset - ETL Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline processes the World Happiness data from multiple CSV files spanning the years 2015 to 2019. The goal is to prepare a clean, consistent dataset ready for analysis, modeling, and visualization.\n",

    "## Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Extract\n",
    "- Load all five CSV files (`2015.csv`, `2016.csv`, `2017.csv`, `2018.csv`, `2019.csv`) into separate dataframes.\n",
    "- Each file contains similar but not identical columns, with some variations in column names and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2. Transform\n",
    "- Standardize column names across all datasets for consistency. For example, rename columns like `Country or region` to `Country`.\n",
    "- Handle missing values:\n",
    "  - Use imputation methods (mean, median, or model-based) or drop columns/rows based on analysis needs.\n",
    "- Convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., numeric).\n",
    "- Merge the datasets into a single combined dataframe with a `Year` column indicating the data year.\n",
    "- Create additional features such as:\n",
    "  - Year-over-year changes\n",
    "  - Regional groupings (e.g., continents)\n",
    "  - Happiness categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High)\n",
    "- Conduct quality checks to ensure data integrity after transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Load\n",
    "- Save the cleaned and transformed dataset into a new CSV file.\n",
