    "\n",
    "####  What’s Included\n",
    "- Formulation of null and alternative hypotheses  \n",
    "- Selection and application of appropriate statistical tests\n",
    "- Step-by-step hypothesis testing process  \n",
    "- Interpretation of p-values and conclusions  \n",
    "- Data visualisation to support findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factors Tested\n",
    "1. **Family support** – Is there a significant difference in Happiness Score based on family support levels?  \n",
    "2. **Healthy life expectancy** – Does better health significantly impact happiness?  \n",
    "3. **Continent** – Does happiness significantly differ across continents?  \n",
    "4. **Generosity** – Despite low correlation, does generosity still show a significant effect on happiness?\n",
